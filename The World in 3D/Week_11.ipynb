        "2. Connect to your folder with the building shapefiles\n",
        "\n",

        "1. Go to the \"Insert\" tab\n",

        "2. Select the dropdown menu with the option to add a new map.\n",
        "  - select \"local scene\"\n",
        "  - a 3D scene should now generate\n",

        "\n",
        "4. Select one of the shapefiles in the table of contents.\n",
