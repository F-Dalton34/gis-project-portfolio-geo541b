## Overview
- This repository contains Google Colab Notebooks prepared for GEO 441/541 @Miami University

## Assignments

- [Introduction to ArcGIS Pro - Week 1](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/General%20Mapping/introduction_to_arcgis_pro_gui.ipynb)
  - The deliverable of the assignment was a map of the Cloquet Forestry Center. The goal was to obtain a level of familiarity and proficency with the basic-level functions of ArcGIS Pro and gain experience with Google Collab Notebooks. 
  
- [Data Model and More Mapping - Week 2]([Weekly_Assignments/data_model_and_more_mapping.ipynb](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/General%20Mapping/data_model_and_more_mapping.ipynb))
  - This assignment continues teaching the basics of ArcGIS Pro: creating maps, working with data, and creating map layouts using multiple map frames. Additionally, the goal was to create a geodatabase and feature dataset. The final deliverable was presented in the format of a Google Collab Notebook. 

- [Projecting Geographic Data - Week 3](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/General%20Mapping/projecting_geographic_data.ipynb)
  - The assignment teaches the basic methods for map projections in ArcGIS Pro. A projected map of Minnesora county boundaries with an inset global view was created. The final deliverable was presented in the format of a Google Collab Notebook. 

- [Query Spatial Data for New Insights - Week 5](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/Spatial%20Analysis/query_spatial_data_for_new_insights.ipynb)
    - The assignment provides practice with tabular data management in ArcGIS Pro. Throughout the assingment, tabular data was viewed, selected, re-ordered, and updated. The goal was to produce a map showing high population counties with high old/young ratios for counties in the contiguous U.S. using 2000 U.S. Census data, as well as a map showing soil fertility in a portion of Mancon Country, North Carolina. The final deliverable was spresented in the format of a Google Collab Notebook. 

- [Mapping Digital Elevation and Hydrology Data - Week 8](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/Raster%20and%20Satellite%20Data/Mapping_digital_elevation_and_hydrology_data.ipynb)
    - The assignment introduces some connomly available digital data sets and basic ways to use these data. The goal for the assignment was to create a map for a digital elevation model of Lower St. Croix watershed in Minnesota and the hydraulic data from National Hydraulic Data (NHD). Additionally, a raster data set that could be used for a group project needed to be identified. The final deliverable was spresented in the format of a Google Collab Notebook. 

- [Spatial Analysis for Raster Data - Week 9](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/Spatial%20Analysis/Raster%20Data.ipynb) 

- [Practice Spatial Analysis for Vector Data - Week 10](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/Spatial%20Analysis/Spatial%20Analysis%20for%20Vector%20Data.ipynb)

- [Creating 3D Features with Multipatch Texture - Extra Credit - Week 11](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/The%20World%20in%203D/Week_11.ipynb)

- [Working with US Census Data for Spatial Analysis - Week 12](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/Spatial%20Analysis/Week_12.ipynb)
