## Overview
- This repository contains Google Colab Notebooks prepared for GEO 441/541 @Miami University

## Assignments

- [Introduction to ArcGIS Pro - Week 1](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/General%20Mapping/introduction_to_arcgis_pro_gui.ipynb)
  - The deliverable of the assignment was a map of the Cloquet Forestry Center. The goal was to obtain a level of familiarity and proficency with the basic-level functions of ArcGIS Pro and gain experience with Google Collab Notebooks. 
  
- [Data Model and More Mapping - Week 2]([Weekly_Assignments/data_model_and_more_mapping.ipynb](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/General%20Mapping/data_model_and_more_mapping.ipynb))
  - This assignment continues teaching the basics of ArcGIS Pro: creating maps, working with data, and creating map layouts using multiple map frames. Additionally, the goal was to create a geodatabase and feature dataset. The final deliverable was presented in the format of a Google Collab Notebook. 

- [Projecting Geographic Data - Week 3](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/General%20Mapping/projecting_geographic_data.ipynb)
  - The assignment teaches the basic methods for map projections in ArcGIS Pro. A projected map of Minnesora county boundaries with an inset global view was created. The final deliverable was presented in the format of a Google Collab Notebook. 

- [Query Spatial Data for New Insights - Week 5](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/Spatial%20Analysis/query_spatial_data_for_new_insights.ipynb)
    - The assignment provides practice with tabular data management in ArcGIS Pro. Throughout the assingment, tabular data was viewed, selected, re-ordered, and updated. The goal was to produce a map showing high population counties with high old/young ratios for counties in the contiguous U.S. using 2000 U.S. Census data, as well as a map showing soil fertility in a portion of Mancon Country, North Carolina. The final deliverable was spresented in the format of a Google Collab Notebook. 

- [Mapping Digital Elevation and Hydrology Data - Week 8](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/Raster%20and%20Satellite%20Data/Mapping_digital_elevation_and_hydrology_data.ipynb)
    - The assignment introduces some connomly available digital data sets and basic ways to use these data. The goal for the assignment was to create a map for a digital elevation model of Lower St. Croix watershed in Minnesota and the hydraulic data from National Hydraulic Data (NHD). Additionally, a raster data set that could be used for a group project needed to be identified. The final deliverable was spresented in the format of a Google Collab Notebook. 

- [Spatial Analysis for Raster Data - Week 9](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/Spatial%20Analysis/Raster%20Data.ipynb)
    - The tutorial introduces the georeferencing tool, which was used on a campus map of Miami University. Additionally, hillshade and slope of a digital elevation model (DEM) of the campus was calculation. Zonal statistics in the City of Oxford were run to identify the parcels with relatively steep slope. The assignment consisted of three parts: using the USFS 3DEP DEM to create a topographic map of the city of Oxford, OH; georeferencing a campus map to create a map on the background of the hillshade previously derived; and a map addressing the zonal statistics of each parcel in Oxford. The final deliverable was spresented in the format of a Google Collab Notebook.

- [Practice Spatial Analysis for Vector Data - Week 10](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/Spatial%20Analysis/Spatial%20Analysis%20for%20Vector%20Data.ipynb)
    - The assignment applies the concepts of buffering and overlay to create maps relating to lake variable distance buffers, suitable recreation areas, and which of those areas are on private land only. Additionally, two maps of Cholera deaths in Soho, London during the 1850s outbreak was created using buffers and heat maps. The final deliverable was spresented in the format of a Google Collab Notebook.

- [Creating 3D Features with Multipatch Texture - Extra Credit - Week 11](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/The%20World%20in%203D/Week_11.ipynb)
    - The goal of the assignemnt was to create a zip file for 3D buildings using ArcGIS Pro. Data was provided from a previous group assignment involving scale calculations to obtain the building's height. Each student was required to complete three buildings (assigned by the professor) with multi-patch textures of the street-facing facade. The final deliverable was a zip file submitted onto canvas, however, students were able to recieve extra credit for creating a Google Collab Notebook. 

- [Working with US Census Data for Spatial Analysis - Week 12](https://github.com/F-Dalton34/gis-project-portfolio-geo541b/blob/main/Spatial%20Analysis/Week_12.ipynb)
     - The assignment teaches the basics of obtaining U.S. Census Data and TIGER/Line geodatabases to create two maps. The first map displays the school-aged children per 1,000 people in Ohio at the tract level. The second map shows a normalized metric for the final group project. A map displaying the average yearly income spent on rent in Ohio at the tract level was created to show a correlation between income and the estimated cost of housing. The map would be beneficial to compare the cost of housing to the percentage of ownership. The final deliverable was spresented in the format of a Google Collab Notebook.
